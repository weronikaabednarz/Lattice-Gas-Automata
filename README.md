# Lattice Gas Automata

Imitation of the movement of substance molecules.
 
Project description:

The 'draw' function is responsible for drawing the board based on the image, changing the colours where the squares are located - it goes through each element of the board, checks its colour and draws a square in the appropriate place. The colour of the square is determined by the value in the matrix. Finally, the current state of the board is saved to a graphics file.
The "walking" function is responsible for simulating the movement of the squares on the board according to the rules of the automatic cellular automata.

Technologies used in the project: Python with libraries:
- numpy - a library for scientific calculations, operations on multidimensional arrays and matrices,
- pygame - a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Pygame adds functionality on top of the excellent SDL library,
- random - a built-in module that you can use to make random numbers,
- PIL - a module for image handling.
