# Lattice Gas Automata

Imitation of the movement of gas molecules.

Project description:

The 'draw' function is responsible for drawing the board based on the image, changing the colours where the squares are located - it goes through each element of the board, checks its colour and draws a square in the appropriate place. The colour of the square is determined by the value in the matrix. Finally, the current state of the board is saved to a graphics file.
The "walking" function is responsible for simulating the movement of the squares on the board according to the rules of the automatic cellular automata.
